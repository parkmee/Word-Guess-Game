# Safari Hangman
At the start of the game, a safari-themed word is selected from an array of word choices. A new array is populated with blanks whose number is equal to the length of the word; these blanks will be replaced with letters of the word as they are guessed correctly, and this array populates the view on screen. The player enters letters on the keyboard to guess the letters of the word. An incorrect guess will decrement the number of guesses left and display the letter on screen. Validation exists to warn players of repeated letters or non-letter entries. The game is lost if the number of guesses runs out before the word is guess. A winning game will trigger an elephant sound.

## Getting Started

Press any key to start the game. Guess letters of the word using the keyboard. Complete the word before the guesses run out to win.
